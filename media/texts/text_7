Now it is hard to imagine a book less suitable for such a purpose
than Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It is true that Zarathustra had
famously said, “You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I
tell you: it is the good war that hallows any cause” (p. ), but even that
passage is surrounded by claims that the highest aspiration is actually to
be a “saint of knowledge,” and that only failing that should one become
a warrior (what sort of continuum could this be?), and that the “highest
thought” of such warriors should be one commanded by Zarathustra, and
it should have nothing to do with states and territory but with the injunction that human being shall be overcome. (What armies would be fighting
whom in such a cause?) Moreover one wonders what “inspiration and
consolation” our “literate soldiers” could have found in the Fellini-esque
title character, himself hardly possessed of a “warlike nature,” chronically indecisive, sometimes self-pitying, wandering, speechifying, dancing about and encouraging others to dance, consorting mostly with animals, confused disciples, a dwarf, and his two mistresses.
